# Deploy jenkins on Ubuntu and Centos


This is for fun and demo only, it is  not inteded 
for production or as an example of good patterns, 
it just works.

Very much work in progress and because I couldn't find
a good alternative using Oracle JDK because it's not
easy to stray from the standard openjdk package.

included there is also a vagrant file where you can build
different machines, and setup ansible.cfg ;) that part
it's not included now, maybe in the future as work 
progresses...

Note the vagrant is commented out so it works out of the 
box, once you understand the options uncomment and use
the additional options.

Profit!
